# Project: Localstorage

## About
I've been doing some form of web development for about seven years or so... mostly basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've taken two of [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com) nanodegree programs: Front End and Full Stack Web Developer. I have learned a lot from those courses but I know that there are situations and use cases that I haven't seen or been exposed to.

I recently heard about Wes Bos and also his 30 Day JavaScript challenge. It's a free course (at least during the writing of this) and it can be found here: [javascript30.com](https://javascript30.com)

This project is a practice in writing vanilla JavaScript and to learn about other use cases.

#### Project takeaways
* `localStorage` - A way to store data locally. It can only be stored as a string therefore objects must be converted to string format.
* `JSON.stringify` - Used to convert the object array into a string so that it can be stored in localStorage.
* `JSON.parse` - Used to read localStorage and convert the string into an array of objects. 
* `e.preventDefault()` - When clicking Submit on a form, the default action of the page is to go to another page or refresh. This prevents that from happening.
